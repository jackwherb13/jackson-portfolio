        I’m a Computer Science junior at George Mason University with a strong interest in
        software development, systems programming, and applied AI. I primarily work on
        backend and systems-level projects, with a strong focus on performance, reliability,
        and clean implementation.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-white/80">
        I’m currently working as an AI Platform Beta Tester & Software Developer Intern at
        Blackwire Labs, where I test production systems, develop Python automation scripts,
        and evaluate large language model workflows. Outside of tech, I’m a Division I
        volleyball captain and SAAC representative, balancing athletics with a demanding
        academic and professional schedule.
